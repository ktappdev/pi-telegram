# pi-telegram

Telegram DM bridge for pi.

## Install

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/ktappdev/pi-telegram
```

Or for a single run:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/ktappdev/pi-telegram
```

## Configure

### Telegram

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Pick a name and username
4. Copy the bot token

### pi

Start pi, then run:

```bash
/telegram-setup
```

Paste the bot token when prompted.

The extension stores config in:

```text
~/.pi/agent/telegram.json
```

## Connect a pi session

The Telegram bridge is session-local. Connect it only in the pi session that should own the bot:

```bash
/telegram-connect
```

If the bot is already connected to another session, you'll see a warning. Disconnect from the other session first.

To stop polling in the current session:

```bash
/telegram-disconnect
```

Check status:

```bash
/telegram-status
```

## Pair your Telegram account

After token setup and `/telegram-connect`:

1. Open the DM with your bot in Telegram
2. Send `/start`

The first DM user becomes the allowed Telegram user for the bridge. The extension only accepts messages from that user.

## Usage

Chat with your bot in Telegram DMs.

### Send text

Send any message in the bot DM. It is forwarded into pi with a `[telegram]` prefix.

### Send images and files

Send images, albums, or files in the DM.

The extension:
- downloads them to `~/.pi/agent/tmp/telegram`
- includes local file paths in the prompt
- forwards inbound images as image inputs to pi

### Ask for files back

If you ask pi for a file or generated artifact, pi should call the `telegram_attach` tool. The extension then sends those files with the next Telegram reply.

Examples:
- `summarize this image`
- `read this README and summarize it`
- `write me a markdown file with the plan and send it back`
- `generate a shell script and attach it`

### Stop a run

In Telegram, send:

```text
stop
```

or:

```text
/stop
```

That aborts the active pi turn.

### Queue follow-ups

If you send more Telegram messages while pi is busy, they are queued and processed in order.

## Streaming

The extension streams assistant text previews back to Telegram while pi is generating.

It tries Telegram draft streaming first with `sendMessageDraft`. If that is not supported for your bot, it falls back to `sendMessage` plus `editMessageText`.

## Notes

- Only one pi session should be connected to the bot at a time (see Multi-session protection below)
- Replies are sent as normal Telegram messages, not quote-replies
- Long replies are split below Telegram's 4096 character limit
- Outbound files are sent via `telegram_attach`

## Features

### Multi-session protection

The extension uses a lock file (`~/.pi/agent/telegram-locks.json`) to prevent accidentally connecting the same bot token in multiple pi sessions.

If you try to connect when another session is already using the bot:
- You'll see a warning with the other session's PID
- The connection is blocked until you disconnect from the other session

To disconnect from another session, use `/telegram-disconnect` in that pi session.

### Stale lock recovery

If a pi session crashes or is killed while connected, the lock is automatically detected as stale after 1 hour. On next connect attempt, the extension:
- Reclaims the stale lock automatically
- Notifies you that it recovered from a previous session

Stale locks are also cleaned up on pi startup.

### Time gap detection

When resuming a conversation after more than 24 hours, the extension:
- Prepends a notice to the prompt so pi knows this may be a fresh context
- Pi is informed that you're messaging from Telegram (mobile-first, async)

Example notice: `[telegram] ⚠️ It's been 3 days since your last message. You may be starting a fresh conversation.`

This helps pi understand that you might be starting a new topic rather than continuing a previous conversation.
